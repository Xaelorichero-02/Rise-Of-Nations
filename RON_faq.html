               <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
               <h3>1) WHY ARE SOME START DATES "EMPTY"?</h1>
                  <div>We are working on the eras one at a time, they will be completed one at a time in chronological order. A mod this size doesn't just poof out of thin air, it takes hundreds of hours to make. Keep in mind we are not just replacing Mussolini with a Cat, we are taking a Game thats 12 years long, and expanding it to 160 years long.</div>
                  <h3>2) OMG YOU STOLE STUFF FROM OTHER MODS!!</h1>
                  <div>The whole purpose of modding is sharing. If we do decide to use something from another mod, it will only be with their express permission, backed by a screenshot. We are not competing with any other mods, as we are a timeline expansion mod.</div>
                  <h3>3) HOW DO I CHANGE TO THE NEXT ERA FOCUS TREES?</h1>
                  <div>Focus trees are reloaded each era by an era change event, which is triggered by decision. You can trigger it manually when the conditions are set, but don't worry, if you don't the AI will do it for you.</div>
                  <h3>4) I CAN’T CHANGE SUCH AND SUCH LAW!</h1>
                  <div>If you can’t change a law you either do not meet the requirements, the law changes automatically by event, or it hasn’t been implemented yet.</div>
                  <h3>5) MANDARIN CHINESE TRANSLATION WHEN?</h1>
                  <div>Due to the massive amount of work to be done to bring this project to completion, any translation that gets done, will be done by the community. We have enough on our hands.</div>
                  <h3>6) OMG RISE OF NATIONS IS THE NAME OF A GAME!</h1>
                  <div>There's a thing called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use>Fair Use</a>...</div>
                  <h3>7) CUSTOM FOCUS TREE FOR X COUNTRY WHEN?</h1>
                  <div>We are gonna do a event, decision and focus tree expansion for each era, one at a time. Please check #planned-updates</div>
                  <h3>8) HOW CAN I JOIN THE DEV TEAM/BECOME A HELPER?</h1>
                  <div>90% of people who volunteer don't do jack shit. So please think twice before joining. If you are serious about joining, then please check the: #read-before-applying channel.</div>
                  <h3>9) WHY ARE THE RULES SO STRICT ON OUR DISCORD?</h1>
                  <div>We have bumped our security settings to the max in response to relentless trolling.</div>
                  <h3>10) WHY ARE THERE MODS IN THE CREDITS LIST THAT HAVEN'T BEEN USED?</h1>
                  <div>The mods in the credit list are mods that gave us permission back when we were Totaler Krieg. Although we plan on redoing everything ourselves this time around, we keep them on our credit list to honor their generosity and good spirit, which is what modding is all about.</div>
                  <h3>11) WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?</h1>
                  <div>We are gonna expand each era one at a time, and add focuses/events. Please check the Planned Updates Channel for more info.</div>
                  <h3>12) WHAT SCENARIOS DO YOU RECOMMEND?</h1>
                  <div>1900, 1910, 1919 and 1933</div>
                  <h3>13) WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT ERAS ?</h1>
                  <div>- Dawn Of A New Century (DNC): 1900-1909 (9 Years)</div>
                  <div>- World War 1 (WW1): 1910-1918 (8 Years)</div>

                  <h3>14) I CAN'T LOAD THE MOD, IT KEEPS CRASHING!</h1>
                  <div>Some people get this issue, while we do not know what is causing it, we can offer you a solution:</div>
                  <div>- Open Steam</div>
                  <div>- Right Click Hoi4 and go to Properties</div>
                  <div>- In Launch Parameters type '-opengl' without the quotes</div>
                  <div>- Run the game as usual</div>
                  <h3>15) THE MOD DOESN'T LOAD, IT LOADS VANILLA INSTEAD!</h1>
                  <div>If the mod launches vanilla make sure that it is inside the playset you are currently using. If it still doesn't work, clear you user folder. If that still doesn't work, unsubscribe from the mod, wait a few minutes, then resubscribe.</div>
                  <h3>16) WILL YOU ADD AN ECONOMY/TRADE SYSTEM?</h1>
                  <div>Maybe, we can't guarantee adding such a system as it is quite hard to balance and to find historical data ranging from 1900-Today to make sure it goes more or less historical. If you have any knowledge about economics and/or if you have good sources, please contact us</div>
                  <h3>17) WILL YOU MAKE GFX UPDATES?</h1>
                  <div>GFX changes are not standalone updates, we are improving icons and portraits in every update we release. Should you find any bad portrait, please report it in #bad-portraits on our Discord</div>
                  <h3>18) I ASKED FOR ... CONTENT, BUT YOU ARE NOT WORKING ON IT!</h1>
                  <div>We are working on what the community wants, we will do regular polls to ask what the next update should be. Make sure to participate to the polls. </div>
