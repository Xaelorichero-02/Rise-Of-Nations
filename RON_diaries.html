                <p>Greetings, commanders!</p>
                
                <p>Today we're excited to unveil our complete rework of the Russian Empire focus tree. This has been one of our most requested features, and we're proud to finally share it with you. The new Russian focus tree includes over 120 new focuses spanning multiple paths and ideologies, allowing for unprecedented historical and alternate history gameplay.</p>
                
                <h3>Historical Background</h3>
                <p>The Russian Empire in 1910 was at a crucial turning point. Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905, Tsar Nicholas II's government was implementing reforms while struggling with growing revolutionary sentiment. The period ahead would determine whether the 300-year Romanov dynasty would adapt to the modern era or collapse under the weight of its contradictions.</p>

                <h3>Major Paths</h3>
                <p>The new focus tree offers several major paths for Russia:</p>
                
                <h4>1. The Romanov Renaissance</h4>
                <p>Navigate the challenges of modernizing the empire while preserving the autocracy. Implement the Stolypin reforms, build a constitutional monarchy, or reassert absolute Tsarist power. This path offers significant industrial and military bonuses but requires careful management of social tensions.</p>
                
                <h4>2. The February Revolution</h4>
                <p>Embrace democratic reforms through the Provisional Government. Choose between the liberal Kadet party, moderate socialists, or Kerensky's leadership. This path offers strong diplomatic options with the Western powers but faces challenges from both reactionaries and radicals.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Soviet Russia</h4>
                <p>Accelerate revolutionary change through the Bolsheviks, Left SRs, or various other socialist factions. Implement War Communism, the NEP, or forge your own economic path. This branch includes sub-paths for Trotskyism, Stalinism, and other variants of Soviet governance.</p>
                
                <h4>4. White Movement</h4>
                <p>If the revolution occurs, lead the counter-revolutionary forces to restore order. Choose between monarchist restoration, military dictatorship under figures like Kolchak or Denikin, or a democratic White republic.</p>

                <h3>New Mechanics</h3>
                <p>The Russia rework includes several new gameplay mechanics:</p>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>Duma Politics System</h4>
                    <p>A new parliamentary system modeling the State Duma, where various political factions compete for influence. Government policies now require negotiation with the different Duma factions, and election events can shift the balance of power.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>Provincial Management</h4>
                    <p>Russia's vast territories now have a regional management system. Different regions (Central Russia, Ukraine, Caucasus, Central Asia, Siberia, Far East) have unique development paths and autonomy levels that affect resource extraction, partisans, and core manpower.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>Industrialization Campaigns</h4>
                    <p>Choose between different industrialization models, from the Trans-Siberian Railway expansion to the NEP or Five-Year Plans, each with unique bonuses and penalties.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
                <p>Russia's international relations have been completely reworked:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>European Strategy:</strong> Choose between the Franco-Russian Alliance, reconciliation with Germany, or isolation</li>
                    <li><strong>Asian Ambitions:</strong> Detailed options for expansion or cooperation in the Far East, Central Asia, and Persia</li>
                    <li><strong>Pan-Slavism:</strong> New decisions and events for Russian influence in the Balkans and potential conflicts with Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1750187820840835442/AFD6C4A988A73E8D7ADAFEDA5EADE6E69D92EC92/" alt="Russian Foreign Policy Options">
                
                <h3>Military Tree</h3>
                <p>The Russian military doctrine has been expanded with three main branches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Russian Steamroller:</strong> Mass mobilization and human wave tactics</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Over Quantity:</strong> Modernization and professionalization of the army</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Battle Theory:</strong> Early development of combined arms and mechanized warfare</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Additionally, special attention has been given to the Russian Navy, with options to develop the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, or Pacific Fleet based on your strategic priorities.</p>
                
                <h3>World War I Scenario</h3>
                <p>For 1914 start dates, we've added detailed events and decisions for Russia's role in World War I, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Brusilov Offensive</li>
                    <li>Managing war exhaustion and revolutionary sentiment</li>
                    <li>Rasputin's influence on the government</li>
                    <li>The Romanian front</li>
                    <li>Options for separate peace with Germany</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>We're incredibly proud of this rework and believe it offers the most detailed and historically accurate representation of Russia during this tumultuous period in any strategy game. The new focus tree allows for countless alternate history scenarios while remaining grounded in the real historical challenges and opportunities that Russia faced.</p>
                
                <p>Next week, we'll be discussing our upcoming overhaul of the French Republic, so stay tuned!</p>

                <p>Hello everyone!</p>
                
                <p>This week we're focusing on the Empire of Japan and its expanded focus tree. The new Japan rework has been in development for over six months, and we're excited to finally share it with you all.</p>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1860559791906001622/E27F14A1E3DA8D50FD0A80AE4D2E1B8F4B9B07F6/" alt="Japanese Empire Focus Tree Overview">
                
                <h3>Early 20th Century Japan</h3>
                <p>The early 20th century was a time of dramatic transformation for Japan. Having emerged victorious from the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Japan had established itself as a formidable power in East Asia. However, the nation still faced significant challenges: balancing traditional values with modernization, managing colonial possessions, and securing its place among the world's great powers.</p>
                
                <p>Our focus tree now properly models the complexity of this period, beginning in 1910 during the Meiji era and extending through the Taishō Democracy period, the militarization of the 1930s, and beyond.</p>
                
                <h3>Main Focus Tree Branches</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Imperial Politics</h4>
                <p>The Imperial Politics branch has been completely reworked to reflect the factional struggles within Japan's government:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Genrō</strong> - Navigate the influence of the elder statesmen who shaped Japan's policies</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Parties</strong> - Choose between the Seiyūkai, Minseitō, or other political movements</li>
                    <li><strong>The Taishō Democracy Path</strong> - Maintain and strengthen Japan's experiment with democratic governance</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Dominance</strong> - Embrace the growing influence of the Army and Navy in politics</li>
                    <li><strong>The Shōwa Restoration</strong> - Radical reform of the state under imperial guidance</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1796366852738854757/C2A6CD50EDAF6F6EA78C4EC8A9B5810D51E5773B/" alt="Japan Political Paths">
                
                <h4>2. Economic Development</h4>
                <p>Japan's economic challenges and opportunities are now modeled in detail:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zaibatsu Relations</strong> - Determine the role of Japan's powerful industrial conglomerates</li>
                    <li><strong>Rural Development</strong> - Address the needs of Japan's agricultural regions</li>
                    <li><strong>Colonial Economics</strong> - Exploit or develop Japan's colonial possessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade Security</strong> - Secure resources and markets through diplomacy or force</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>New Mechanic: Resource Dependency</h4>
                    <p>Japan now has a unique "Resource Dependency" mechanic that models its reliance on imported materials. This creates strategic vulnerabilities that players must address through trade agreements, colonial development, or military expansion.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h4>3. Naval Supremacy</h4>
                <p>As an island nation, Japan's naval strategy is crucial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fleet Doctrine</strong> - Choose between historical Kantai Kessen (Decisive Battle), submarine warfare, or carrier-focused strategies</li>
                    <li><strong>Naval Treaties</strong> - Adhere to, circumvent, or abandon international naval limitations</li>
                    <li><strong>Shipbuilding Program</strong> - Detailed options for developing Japan's various ship classes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>New Naval Mechanic: Base Network</h4>
                    <p>Japan now has a "Naval Base Network" system that models the importance of forward bases in projecting power across the Pacific. These bases require development and protection, adding strategic depth to naval warfare.</p>
                </div>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1750187820840835454/B8C1AE00A0A5FCD9A8F07471D6AFF53E1C8BB0F8/" alt="Japanese Naval Forces">
                
                <h4>4. Army Modernization</h4>
                <p>The Imperial Japanese Army gets extensive focus options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kwantung Army</strong> - Special branch for Japan's continental forces in Manchuria</li>
                    <li><strong>Infantry Doctrine</strong> - Choose between spiritual training (Seishin) or technology-focused approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Forces</strong> - Develop Japan's elite units, including paratroopers and SNLF (Special Naval Landing Forces)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>5. Foreign Policy</h4>
                <p>Japan's international relations have been completely rebuilt:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anglo-Japanese Alliance</strong> - Maintain, strengthen, or abandon the alliance with Britain</li>
                    <li><strong>China Policy</strong> - Detailed options for Japanese influence in China, from the 21 Demands to outright conquest</li>
                    <li><strong>Pan-Asianism</strong> - Develop the Co-Prosperity Sphere with various approaches to satellite states</li>
                    <li><strong>Relations with the West</strong> - Diplomatic paths for dealing with the United States, Soviet Union, and European powers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>New Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
                
                <h4>Faction Politics</h4>
                <p>The internal struggles between the Army and Navy, civilian government, and imperial court are now modeled through a faction system. Major decisions require balancing the interests of these groups, with consequences for favoritism.</p>
                
                <h4>Colonial Management</h4>
                <p>Japan's colonies (Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and potentially Manchuria) are now managed through a dedicated interface. Players can choose between exploitation, integration, or autonomous development, each with unique bonuses and penalties.</p>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1835782860787762884/5F5D5B17471C80CD89B7173CC8E5DB22A1A3FC31/" alt="Colonial Management System">
                
                <h4>War Cabinet System</h4>
                <p>During major conflicts, Japan now has a War Cabinet system that models the strategic decision-making process. Players must balance immediate military needs with long-term sustainability, making crucial decisions about resource allocation, conscription policies, and diplomatic initiatives.</p>
                
                <h3>Unique Units and Equipment</h3>
                <p>Japan now has several unique units and equipment types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yamato-class Battleships</strong> - The world's largest battleships, with unique advantages and drawbacks</li>
                    <li><strong>I-400 Class Submarines</strong> - Aircraft-carrying submarines with special operations capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized Infantry Equipment</strong> - Including the unique Japanese Type 38 and Type 99 rifle series</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Naval Landing Forces</strong> - Elite marine units with improved amphibious capabilities</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Historical Scenarios</h3>
                <p>The Japan rework includes several preset historical scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Siberian Intervention</strong> - Japan's expedition into eastern Russia during the Russian Civil War</li>
                    <li><strong>The Manchurian Incident</strong> - The staged incident that led to Japan's occupation of Manchuria</li>
                    <li><strong>The Marco Polo Bridge Incident</strong> - The spark that ignited full-scale war with China</li>
                    <li><strong>The Pacific War</strong> - Japan's conflict with the Western powers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Coming Next Week</h3>
                <p>Next week's dev diary will cover our complete rework of the Russian Empire, including its transition through various political systems depending on player choices.</p>

                <p>For this milestone entry, we're excited to present our complete economic overhaul. This has been one of our most ambitious projects yet, requiring coordination between multiple team members over several months. The result is a dynamic economic system that evolves throughout the game's extended timeline, providing both historical accuracy and engaging gameplay.</p>

                <h3>Core Economic Systems</h3>
                <p>The new economic system includes several core components that work together:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Expanded Resources</h4>
                <p>In addition to the vanilla HOI4 resources, we've added:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Materials</strong> - Specialized resources like aluminum, titanium, and uranium</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Materials</strong> - Rare earths, phosphates, and other critical minerals</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Goods</strong> - Representing general consumer products</li>
                    <li><strong>Electronics</strong> - Essential for advanced technology (especially in later eras)</li>
                    <li><strong>Services</strong> - Representing the tertiary sector (especially important post-1960)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>Resource Evolution</h4>
                    <p>Resources change in importance throughout the timeline. Oil becomes increasingly critical in the interwar period, while electronics and services become dominant economic factors in the late Cold War and modern era.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h4>2. Economic Development System</h4>
                <p>Nations now have dynamic economic development levels that influence production efficiency, research capacity, and resource extraction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Industrial</strong> - Limited manufacturing, primarily agricultural and resource extraction</li>
                    <li><strong>Early Industrial</strong> - Basic manufacturing capacity, emerging industrial base</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial</strong> - Solid manufacturing base, standard for most major powers by 1936</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Industrial</strong> - Sophisticated manufacturing, automation, and early computers</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-Industrial</strong> - Service-oriented economies with high-tech manufacturing sectors</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Economy</strong> - Digital economy with cutting-edge technological capabilities</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Nations can progress through these stages via specific focuses, decisions, and technologies, allowing historically underdeveloped nations to industrialize and modernize.</p>

                <h4>3. Production Chains</h4>
                <p>Resources and factories now operate in interconnected production chains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mining and drilling operations produce raw materials</li>
                    <li>Processing facilities refine them into industrial materials</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing converts materials into consumer goods, military equipment, and infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Advanced economies develop service sectors that boost overall efficiency</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These chains create strategic interdependencies. Disrupting key nodes through strategic bombing or naval blockades can cripple an enemy's economy more effectively than simply targeting military factories.</p>
                
                <h4>4. Trade and Economic Blocs</h4>
                <p>The trade system has been significantly expanded:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trade Agreements</strong> - Bilateral and multilateral trade deals with varying benefits</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Blocs</strong> - Regional economic organizations that provide bonuses to member states</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade Routes</strong> - Physical connections that can be disrupted by warfare or sabotage</li>
                    <li><strong>Tariffs and Sanctions</strong> - Economic tools to influence other nations or protect domestic industries</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>New Interface: Global Market</h4>
                    <p>The Global Market interface provides a dynamic view of worldwide resource prices, trade flows, and economic trends. Market prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, and global events, creating opportunities for economic strategy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Era-Specific Economic Models</h3>
                <p>The economic system evolves through several distinct models across our extended timeline:</p>
                
                <h4>1910-1945: Industrial Capitalism and War Economies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-WWI colonial resource extraction and early industrial development</li>
                    <li>Wartime economic mobilization during both World Wars</li>
                    <li>Great Depression mechanics with financial crises and recovery options</li>
                    <li>Autarky vs. international trade choices</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>1945-1991: Mixed Economies and Competing Systems</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Socialist planned economies with Five-Year Plans and specialization</li>
                    <li>Western mixed economies with varying levels of state intervention</li>
                    <li>Development economics for newly independent nations</li>
                    <li>Oil crises and stagflation in the 1970s</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>1991-Present: Globalization and Information Economy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Post-industrial transition with service sector focus</li>
                    <li>Digital economy with knowledge-based industries</li>
                    <li>Global supply chains and economic interdependence</li>
                    <li>Financial markets with influence on political stability</li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1750187820840835442/AFD6C4A988A73E8D7ADAFEDA5EADE6E69D92EC92/" alt="Economic System Overview">
                
                <h3>Advanced Financial Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Beyond basic economics, we've implemented several advanced financial systems:</p>
                
                <h4>1. National Debt and Deficit Spending</h4>
                <p>Nations can now engage in deficit spending to finance wars, development projects, or social programs. However, accumulating debt has consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interest payments that divert industrial capacity</li>
                    <li>Inflation that reduces consumer satisfaction</li>
                    <li>Potential debt crises if financial stability is compromised</li>
                    <li>Credit ratings that affect future borrowing costs</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Currency Management</h4>
                <p>Nations can manage their currencies through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exchange rate policies (gold standard, fixed rates, floating rates)</li>
                    <li>Currency unions with other nations</li>
                    <li>Devaluation to boost exports at the cost of purchasing power</li>
                    <li>Currency wars with competing economic blocs</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Stock Markets and Financial Centers</h4>
                <p>Major economic powers have stock markets that provide economic bonuses but also introduce volatility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market crashes that can trigger wider economic crises</li>
                    <li>Foreign investment options to develop other nations</li>
                    <li>Speculation mechanics that model boom-and-bust cycles</li>
                    <li>Financial center development that attracts global capital</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Industry and Technology Integration</h3>
                <p>The economic system is fully integrated with our expanded technology tree:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Industrial technologies unlock new production methods and resources</li>
                    <li>Scientific breakthroughs create new industries and production chains</li>
                    <li>Computer technology dramatically boosts productivity in later eras</li>
                    <li>Renewable energy eventually reduces dependence on traditional resources</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This integration ensures that economic development and technological progress work hand in hand, creating a satisfying progression throughout the game's timeline.</p>
                
                <h3>Balance and Gameplay Considerations</h3>
                <p>While we've added significant complexity to the economic system, we've carefully balanced it to ensure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beginner-friendly defaults that don't require micromanagement</li>
                    <li>Optional depth for players who want to engage with economic strategy</li>
                    <li>AI capability to effectively manage the new systems</li>
                    <li>Historical plausibility while maintaining fun gameplay</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We've extensively tested these systems to ensure they enhance rather than overwhelm the core Hearts of Iron IV experience.</p>
                
                <h3>Coming Next</h3>
                <p>Next week's dev diary will cover our complete rework of the Japanese Empire, including its naval focus and expansion options in Asia.</p>

                <h3>The World Divided: Spheres of Influence</h3>
                <p>The Cold War era is defined by competing spheres of influence spread across the globe:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Superpower Politics</h4>
                <p>The United States and Soviet Union (and potentially other emerging powers like China) compete for global influence through a new "Sphere of Influence" system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alliance Systems</strong> - NATO, Warsaw Pact, Non-Aligned Movement, and custom alliances</li>
                    <li><strong>Ideological Spread</strong> - Methods to promote your ideology in neutral or rival nations</li>
                    <li><strong>Containment Policies</strong> - Strategies to prevent rival ideological expansion</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>New Interface: Global Influence Map</h4>
                    <p>The Global Influence Map provides a visual representation of ideological control worldwide, with disputed areas, firm alignments, and neutral zones clearly marked.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Espionage Networks</h3>
                <p>Espionage becomes a critical gameplay element during the Cold War:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Intelligence Agencies</h4>
                <p>Enhanced intelligence agencies with specialized departments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Intelligence</strong> - Gathering information abroad (CIA, KGB, MI6, etc.)</li>

                </ul>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <h4>New Mechanic: DEFCON System</h4>
                    <p>The DEFCON (Defense Readiness Condition) system models global tension levels, with increasing risks of nuclear exchange at higher levels. Various actions can increase or decrease the DEFCON level, with major consequences for exceeding DEFCON 2.</p>
